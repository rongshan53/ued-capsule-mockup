##[Week 11] - 5/8/2025

- Added basic bottom tab navigator
- Added additional notes for students
- assets folder work the same as unity, going to store our images, fonts, videos etc.
- if you want to change the app icons and splash screens, you can change at app.json
- screens basically is those pages that you needed in your application
- components could be some of the UI might be re-used in different screen to ease the app maintainance
- for example of component could be products container, in product screen you want to display this, and again maybe in check out screens, you want to use that UI again to show user, then you no need recreate it, just need to call the components again
- utils folder means utilities, normally store for helper functions or some constants or logic that might not affect ui
- for example for utils folder right now is using for loadResources when starting the application, or mainly is for calling some api also.
